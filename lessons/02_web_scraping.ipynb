    "# Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup\n",

    "There are often cases when we'd like to access data from the web, but it is not easily accessible in a database, or a Web API does not exist. In these cases, we may have to resort to web scraping, where we extract the underlying HTML from a web page, and directly obtain the information we want. There are several packages in Python we can use to accomplish these tasks. We'll focus on packages called `requests` and Beautiful Soup.\n",

Before we get started, peruse these websites to take a look at their structure."

Remember that we only want the link to the legislator's bills, not the committees or the legislator's profile page.\n",
    "* The anchor elements' HTML will look like `<a href=\"/senate/Senator.asp/...\">Bills</a>`. The string in the `href` attribute contains the **relative** link we are after. You can access an attribute of a BeatifulSoup `Tag` object the same way you access a Python dictionary: `anchor['attributeName']`. See the <a href=\"http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#tag\">documentation</a> for more details.\n",
