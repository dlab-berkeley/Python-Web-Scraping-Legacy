# Extracting Data from the Internet in Python

This workshop will cover how to extract data from the web using Python. We'll be covering both APIs and webscraping.

### Topics Covered

- How the web works
- Accessing databases via RESTful APIs
- Using a 3rd party Python package to query data from a API
- HTML / CSS 
- Webscraping with Beautiful Soup

### Requirements

This workshop will be using the Python programming language. See the software requirements [here](B_Tech-Requirements.md).

We will assume a basic knowledge of Python. If you've taken the D-Lab's Python Intensive, that should be sufficient. 

## Installation Instructions

Anaconda is a powerful package management software that allows you to run Python and Jupyter notebooks very easily. Installing Anaconda is the easiest way to make sure you have all the necessary software to run the materials for this workshop. Complete the following steps:

1. [Download and install Anaconda (Python 3.8 distribution)](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Click "Download" and then click 64-bit "Graphical Installer" for your current operating system.

2. Download the Extracting Web Data course materials

* Click the green "Code" button in the top right of the repository information.
* Click "Download Zip".
* Extract this file to a folder on your computer where you can easily access it (we recommend Desktop).

3. Optional: if you're familiar with `git`, you can instead clone this repository by opening a terminal and entering `github repo link`.
