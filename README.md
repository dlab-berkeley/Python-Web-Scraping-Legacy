# D-Lab's Python Web Scraping Workshop
API and web scraping workshops

This repository contains the materials for D-Labâ€™s Python Web Scraping Workshop.

These workshops were originally developed by [Rochelle Terman](https://github.com/rochelleterman)

## Workshop Goals

This workshop will cover how to extract data from the web using Python. The two methods of extraction we'll be using are webscraping and APIs. Webscraping is a technique in which you download a webpage's source code and sift through the material to extract your desired data. APIs on the other hand are an official service offered by companies and other entites, which you can directly query their services in order to retrieve their data.

This workshop explains the difference between the two, their advantages/disadvantages, and how to use both responsibly. This workshop is highly recommended for those who seek valuable data that is not readily available for download.

Basic familiarity with Python is assumed. Understanding the material in the [Python Fundamentals](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Fundamentals) and [Python Data Wrangling](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Data-Wrangling) workshops highly recommended.

> To best prepare for this workshop we suggest you: 
>1. Have an **intermediate** knowledge of Python
>2. Understand at a basic level what HTML and CSS are.
>3. Understand nested and mixed python data structures, JSON for example.

### Topics Covered

- How the web works
- HTML / CSS 
- Webscraping with Beautiful Soup
- Using a 3rd party Python package to query data from a RESTFUL API

## Installation Instructions

This workshop will be using the Python programming language, so it is imperative that you have that installed. If not please follow these instructions on how to install or update Python on your computer.

Anaconda is a powerful package management software that allows you to run Python and Jupyter notebooks very easily. Installing Anaconda is the easiest way to make sure you have all the necessary software to run the materials for this workshop. Complete the following steps:

1. [Download and install Anaconda (Python 3.8 distribution)](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Click "Download" and then click 64-bit "Graphical Installer" for your current operating system.

2. Download the [Python-Web-Scraping- workshop materials](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Web-Scraping):

* Click the green "Code" button in the top right of the repository information.
* Click "Download Zip".
* Extract this file to a folder on your computer where you can easily access it (we recommend Desktop).

3. Optional: if you're familiar with `git`, you can instead clone this repository by opening a terminal and entering `https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Web-Scraping.git`.

## Is Python not Working on Your Computer?

If you do not have Python or Anaconda installed and the materials loaded on your workshop by the time it starts, we *strongly* recommend using the UC Berkeley Datahub to run the materials for these lessons. You can access the DataHub by clicking [this link](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdlab-berkeley%2FPython-Web-Scraping%2F&urlpath=tree%2F%2F&branch=main).

The DataHub downloads this repository, along with any necessary packages, and allows you to run the materials in an RStudio instance on UC Berkeley's servers. No installation is necessary from your end - you only need an internet browser and a CalNet ID to log in. By using the DataHub, you can save your work and come back to it at any time. When you want to return to your saved work, just go straight to [DataHub](https://datahub.berkeley.edu), sign in, and you click on the `Python-Web-Scraping` folder.

If you don't have a Berkeley CalNet ID, you can still run these lessons in the cloud, by clicking this button:

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dlab-berkeley/Python-Web-Scraping/HEAD)

By using this button, however, you cannot save your work.


## Run the code

Now that you have all the required software and materials, you need to run the code:

1. Open the Anaconda Navigator application. You should see the green snake logo appear on your screen. Note that this can take a few minutes to load up the first time. 

2. Click the "Launch" button under "Jupyter Notebooks" and navigate through your file system to the `Python-Web-Scraping` folder you downloaded above.

3. Click `1_bs_workbook.ipynb` notebook in the Web Scraping directory to begin.

4. Press Shift + Enter (or Ctrl + Enter) to run a cell.

Note that all of the above steps can be run from the terminal, if you're familiar with how to interact with Anaconda in that fashion. However, using Anaconda Navigator is the easiest way to get started if this is your first time working with Anaconda.
